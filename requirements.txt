1. CUDA-enabled GPU: The program runs on NVIDIA GPUs that support CUDA 
technology, such as NVIDIA GeForce, Tesla, or Quadro series GPUs. 
2. CUDA Toolkit: The CUDA Toolkit is a development environment for creating GPUaccelerated applications. The reverse gray-level program is developed using the 
CUDA C/C++ programming language and requires the CUDA Toolkit to compile 
and execute. 
3. PGM Image File: The program reads in a PGM (Portable Gray Map) image ϐile that 
contains the grayscale image data. 
4. Input and Output File Paths: The program requires the input and output ϐile paths 
as command-line arguments. The input ϐile path is the path to the PGM image ϐile 
to be processed, and the output ϐile path is the path where the resulting 
processed image will be saved.
